# GEOG 328 Lab 4: Interactive Web Mapping
**Instructor:** Bo Zhao

*This repository is a submission for Lab 4 from GEOG 328 Autumn Quarter 2025 at the University of Washington.*



In this repo:
- **index.html**: This is my deliverable for the assignment displaying a choropleth map of Washington State counties. The different shades of blue help visualize the number of cases per 10k people using the *casePer10k* variable in the *wa-covid-data-102521.geojson* file. You are able to see each county name and number of cases by hovering your cursor over the area.
- **pop_density.html**: This is the example html provided showing a choropleth map based on population density. It allows you to see values by state when hovering your mouse over the individual states.
- **assets**: 
  - **stateData.geojson**: This data provides the borders between states in the United States, as well as their individual densities.
  - **wa-covid-data-102521.geojson**:This data set provides the borders of Washington State and its counties, as well as different COVID-19 data. It includes cases per 10k people, deaths per 10k people, and fully vaccinated individuals per 10k people.
